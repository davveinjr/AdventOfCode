# Advent of Code

### Updated Structuring

Originally, I had a repository for just the year 2020, and was going to do a single repository for each year. I've decided that this is not how I want to keep this formatted, so I'm consolidating it all into a single repository and using subfolders for the years/days. 

### Technologies Used

Honestly, I like using AoC as a method to learn new technologies. While I tend to bounce around a lot between Python and a few other languages, I'll likely always use this as a sandbox to try new options. 

### Support Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a fantastic program that runs every single year. It is an advent calendar that presents you with a new puzzle each day of December up until Christmas (December 25th). The difficulty ramps up as each day goes on, so things can get quite challenging for newer programmers like myself. Any language/framework/technology can be used as long as it can take in the input, and spit out the final answer. Additionally, their website gives you access to every previous year (2015 was the first year), so you're more than welcome to continue working backwards until you have every problem completed! Visit [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) and sign up, and consider donating/supporting them through their AoC++ system so they can continue to provide this awesome service to everyone.
